        <h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: white;" ">At first we decided to do a fundraiser to raise money and awareness for victims of domestic violence. That idea got rejected from the fundraising platform so we decided to try again on a different topic. Our teacher mentor helped us decide to do it again but this time on on of our LOIs (how the results of a trial impact a victims family). After a few days we got the news that our fundraiser got rejected again. We decided to leave that idea and start doing a blog through our website about our LOI again, we will write mostly the same things that we wrote on our fundraiser but since it is a blog we are gonna explain our progress as well as how to spread awareness in different ways. We decided that blog will be updated every 2 weeks on our website</h3>
